# Starting with GatsbyJS

## The biggining of a journey

Hi, there! I'm just getting started with working on a blog in Gatsby. I'm really excited to see what all I can do here with markdown!

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Meh. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? And why did 'I' have to take a cab?

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. __Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.__ *We need rest.* The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

## I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

That's not soon enough! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. No! Don't jump! File not found. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!

1. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
2. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
3. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

### OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. No! Don't jump! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

* My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.
* Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
* OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. That's not soon enough! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

You don't know how to do any of those. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

We're rescuing ya. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? I never loved you. That's not soon enough!

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Guess again. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Okay, I like a challenge. It must be wonderful. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! You mean while I'm sleeping in it?

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Throw her in the brig. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. We're rescuing ya. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Tell her she looks thin.

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! You lived before you met me?! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?
